Well, then, let me tell my guest one more of my wonderful stories.

It's hilarious.

It's very unusual.

It's not true.

But it's true.

How can it be? You wonder. I'm sure it's because my story has a super taste and directly blows your mind.

It's straightforward. It might be a little intense for you.

After all, the angle is different. What's the matter with the angle? What are you, stupid? Is it a gag? It is.

The angle of the gag is different, and that's why I said it's a little tough for you.

Because, you know, I've been working on it in my head for a while now, just in case I have to tell this story to someone else.

It was so funny that I started laughing by myself.

For three days, I couldn't stop laughing. I couldn't breathe, I swear.

My accent... it's a little weird, don't you think? The yogurt and garlic breath, you say? I didn't mean that.

It's a new type of mental exercise I've developed. It's a shiritori, a game where you must start each word with the last syllable of the previous one.

You have to make sure you don't end with a "n" when you do this, so you have to be really careful. That's right.

Believe me.

I'm the one who came up with the idea. I didn't copy anyone.

But since I've been doing this kind of thing lately, I've gotten addicted to it.

Even when I'm talking normally, I get confused.

The other day, when I tried to express my feelings for my sweet Melanie, I got a little bit nervous.

I said "I love you as much as standing at the edge of a precipice". 

Since then, Melanie has gone 300 meters deeper and won't come back.

I sighed and I sighed again...It was so hard.

But...you can't stay sad forever...that's against my motto.

Therefore, please smile and be cheerful.

Crying, huh?

Are you a baby?

Oh, my motto?

It's also against my motto to talk about it to unreasonable people.

Well, it's been a while since I've had a visitor, and so that's all right.

Kori is a special case. An exception.

It's not something I normally do.

I didn't say much when Melanie asked about it.

You should have seen the look on Melanie's face when she heard that. How was it? So cute.

Ahhhh, Melanie.

How I love you!

…… …… ……

Melanie!!

Therefore, I am certain that you will remember my motto until the day you die.

It's very profound. Listen up.

It's "Do things that people don't like."

There.

Really? You're laughing at me? That's rude.

Well...

I don't like that.

I am so embarrassed that I have to put up with it.

Oh, damn...

"Shocking" you say...

What do you mean?

Oh I'm hurt. I will never recover. Oh, what should I do? Ah...the pain...

My heart...

Ah.

Must be a heart attack... My heart stopped.

*holds breath*

…… …… …… ……

…… …… …… ……

…… …… …… ……

…… …… …… ……

Bah!!

You idiot. You were really feeling sympathetic, weren't you? Just now.

Uh? You didn't? Don't lie to me!

I saw the look on your face. I was watching with my eyes half-closed and you were nervously panicking. 

You laughed at my motto so I gave you a lesson.

What's so funny about my motto, anyway?

I don't understand. Please explain.

What? You mean my motto has nothing to do with getting back on your feet?

Ah, I can't hide my pity for you.

I feel sorry for you that you can't read the meaning behind those words.

What do you think it means to do something that people don't like, for example? Let's hear it.

Cleaning the toilet. Yeah. Another example?

Removing hair from the drain. Yeah. Another one?

Cleaning the kitchen. Yeah. Another one? You idiot!

You've always been cleaning toilets and drains, haven't you?

Well, that's fine.

Doing things that people don't like...

Patience is the key to success, right?

Perseverance is the key to success, right?

So even if Melanie dug in deep, there's a hidden meaning that says: "Be patient, persevere, and get over it."

What do you think? Amazing, isn't it? I think so.

Is that what I did?

Oh, yeah? You're very impatient, aren't you? You know, keeping someone in suspense is one of the skills of good conversation...

Well, my dad used to say that you can only be impatient with ......

"Only the new wife", I said.

"How dare you say that, you little brat!"

Alright, I'm getting there.

Where should I start?

What do you mean? I'm a bit of a perfectionist, always seeking perfection.

Ah, I remember now.

A sister was born somewhere.

Whose was it? Whose was it?

Oh, here's the funny part.

I wonder if you and I have a point of disagreement. I call it a point, but it's not. Is it?

I really don't know what I'm talking about.

Yeah, that's my sister we're talking about.

The other day, my sister said to me:

"I've come up with a great idea. Brother, listen to me."

She came running so I said to her.

"Don't fall down." And then...

She said, "I won't fall."

She tripped just as she said it. *fall noise* I said "Told you." Then there was a lot of tears.

Who, you ask? Who else but my silly sister? I didn't fall down, I had no reasons to be crying.

Such an actress. I'm a guy so I could tell when she's acting out even if you held me upside down.

Let's get back to the story.

By the way...

What were we talking about?

Oh, you see, right here.

I've been telling you when to laugh for your own sake, you know.

You probably think I'm a boring guy, don't you?

You, my friend, are painfully mistaken.

I just open my mouth and *kaboom*, it's terrific.

I'm telling you.

Believe me.

Well, anyway...

If we get too sidetracked, we won't even know what we're talking about.

I really want to get back to the story.

So my sister barges in. "Brother, listen to me."

So I did.

"I'm listening." Then my sister said.

"I'm not going to fall."

... ...

... ...

What's wrong? You don't think that's funny?

Why was she so assertive when she'd already fallen?

... ...

... ...

A deep mystery...

Deeper than my hole...

A deep mystery...

Oh! It's no exaggeration to say that from now on, my entire life will be dedicated to figuring out this mystery!

That one? Are you asking? I'm getting fired up for the first time in a long time. Don't let me get in the way.

Woohoo!!! Exciting...

Really?

Are you not going to ask if I've ever fallen?

Oh, yes, yes, yes. I've certainly fallen off my feet.

Oh? How did you know that?

... ...

... ...

A deep mystery...

Deeper than Melanie's hole...

A deep mystery...

Hoho I'm excited! Mystery begets mystery! What?!

I already told you about that?

No way, right? 

What?! Did you hear about the time my sister tripped and fell?

... ...

Oh, that's right, that's right. I did tell you, didn't I?

Ah well, as it turns out, the mystery is not much of a mystery at all.

Okay, I'll tell you what happened next, so listen up.

As soon as she said it, she tripped. *fall* How about that?

I still remember that moment when she fell.

Isn't this crazy? Well, there's more to this story.

I was so worried.

Believe me.

So, my sister said...

"The Moon's daughter doesn't want to vaccum her room. She's a bit of a lunatic. Don't worry, it's just a phase."

"The Sun's son comes back from school with a report card. It's stellar. He eclipsed his classmates with astronomical grades."

Genius, right? My little sister. She's only 9 years old. Isn't that amazing?

Hmm? What are you waiting for?

What's wrong with you?

It's very unusual to make a joke out of a story, and yet it's perfect and unique. It's good, isn't it?

I like that kind of thing. Yeah.
