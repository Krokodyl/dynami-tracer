Mole man: I'm going to tell you another story, so pay attention.

My friend... Oh, you don't know my friend. He's a bit of a quipster.

My friend is also a comedic genius.

I think he's so funny, it almost brings tears to my eyes.

I cannot help it.

It's a good opportunity to have a visitor, so let me show you.

It's so funny.

It'll make you split your sides laughing.

It's great.

It's not true.

But it's true.

The other day, when I went out with my friends, I heard a joke.

I'm going to tell you everything right now, so keep your ears open.

Okay, here I go.

1000 rapid-fire jokes. Number one:

She sells clams on the coast.

Hahahahaha. I'm rolling on the floor laughing. I can't stop.

Hmm? What is it? You want to leave cause you don't get it? It's a first for me.

Are you sure you don't want to stay? It's been a long night... but why should I stop?

Don't you dare say that. I know exactly what I'm talking about.

You must really like jokes, don't you?

Right? hmm? hmm?

I see that... It's written all over your pretty face.

Regrettably, it's all being kept secret by my quipster friend.

Can we get on with the next joke now?

Sure thing.

... ...

1000 super rapid-fire jokes.

Hmm? Is that the wrong title? If you don't care about that, you can't live an honest life.

Hmm? Is it too much to ask? Because, you know, you're the one who poked me.

Well then, let's continue.

64 ultra rapid-fire jokes.

Hmm? Wrong title again? What was it...?

What? Not even the numbers?

Now that's a serious issue.

But what is it? You must have a lot of free time to come to this huge desert, don't you?

Hmm?

Desert...

Desert...

*laughs* I just thought of a joke. *laughs*

What do you eat in the desert? Dessert.

*laughs* Dessert in the desert.

*laughs* Now that's a thigh-slapper!

Perfect!

This joke is perfect.

What's wrong? You seem to be in a great hurry, are you?

What's wrong with you? You're holding back your laughter, aren't you?

My jokes are nothing to sneeze at.

Yeah, today I'm really at my peak.

I don't think so. I guess I'm an quipster too, huh?

Speaking of quipster, my friend... he loves horror.

Let me tell you one of my special horror stories.

Title: A chilling story

Somewhere...

*wind noise* *thunder noise*

Hmm? What is it now? What do you mean "sound effects"? The sounds are essential when telling a horror story.

Please listen with an open mind.

Otherwise...

I'll pee my pants.

It's really scary.

It's not true.

But it's true.

*wind noise* *thunder noise*

There's this old mansion...

What kind of a place is your own private home?

What's it called?

Ah, it's a cottage.

... ...

Don't look at me like that.

Because, you know, I'm going to ask.

But why is cottage cheese so delicious?

I bet it's the skimmed milk, so yummy... I guess the cream is good too.

Wait! Who brought that up? Ah, it doesn't matter.

As long as you have desserts and dairy products, you don't need anything else.

Oh, no, no, no. Our conversation is getting derailed.

*dun dun duuun!*

One day, four young men came seeking help.

*knock knock*

They were camping and got lost.

Then, on the fourth day, they found the house.

It's been four days. They've been walking for four days without food.

What's wrong? You seem to be getting restless.

Oh, are you shaking?

Are you trembling with fear?

My storytelling is not so bad.

I haven't told anyone this story yet. Hearing it first is a blessing.

You know what else should be a blessing? A new household... "How dare you say that, you little brat!"

*thunder clap*

Let's get back to the story... one of the four of them... just suddenly disappeared.

The other three got scared. One of them decided to go down the mountain alone.

But he didn't come back. The two of them were trembling, just like you.

*wailing*

After a while, one of them went to look around the house.

He heard a high-pitch screech coming from the kitchen.

There's a monster in there...

The monster, who's wearing an apron, says...

"I'm making a high-scream sandwich!"

... ...

*dun dun!*

Let's move on.

Title: Small stalk

One day... a farmer went to check on his paddy fields...

For some reason, there was only one stalk of rice left.

So, the farmer couldn't help but exclaim, "Ha!"

"Only one stalk...

...in my stock!"

He was not stoked.

... ...

What's the matter? You and I, we don't get each other's sense of humor.

Come on, can't you be more understanding?

Try to find your inner child.

Anyway, as a consolation, I'm going to do something amazing.

I'm going to flip your world upside down.

I developed this great system.

You want to see it? Don't you want to know?

Alright, don't say anything. It's gonna be great.

*from the machine* Tah-dah!

Hmm? The sound is still going on. This is an error.

If I don't get this right, I'm not going to be able to do my best.

This switch should be on...

No, it's off!

... ...

You see, my house is rarely frequented by visitors.

I'm kind of a lone wolf, you know?

Loneliness suits me.

But, in the end, I'm still lonely.

I'm a bit of one half of a comedic duo, that's why I tend to do things by myself.

Just a habit. I don't think it's a problem.

... ...

See, this is it.

Then I'd better switch on the sound machine.

*whirr*	*beep*

Okay, okay, perfect!

I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Let me show you.

This is the "Victory System." An automated audience that wilfully laughs, and pokes fun at the performers.

With this, every time you press the A button, the computer will laughs or pokes fun at you.

Isn't that convenient? Of all my inventions, this is the best one.

*from the machine* What the hell!

Hmm? It's already started. *farts*

*from the machine* Hahahahahahahaha

Even a silly gag like this is well received.

*from the machine* Hihihihihihihihi

Hmm? Don't laugh at that. Seriously.

*from the machine* What the hell!

*from the machine* Hahahahahahahaha

*from the machine* You're way off, my friend.

*from the machine* Woohoo-hoo-hoo!

*from the machine* That's so you, right?

*from the machine* Act properly already!

*from the machine* Thank you very much.

... ...

How can it just end like that?

How long do you think it'll take me to get to the bottom of this?

I'm tired of listening, but I'm even more tired of talking.

Well, that's okay.

Oh, yeah?
