The heart beating fast
Unrequited love of
Declaring your love
"Being in love♥"
Close your eyes
Kiss on the lips
Your heart
Dreamin' ♥
Being ecstatic
Pink lipstick
Good presentiment
Whispers of
"My Darling ♥"
If you kiss me
Foreign Love♥
The angel of love
To hold someone tight
Crazy about you
Two lovers
Don't tell your mom
Murmuring gently
"I'm sorry…"
Just you and me
A dreamland
Love for the first time
I'll never forget
Dreaming girl
A white chapel
A couple's secret
With a smile
"See you later♥"
With cheesecake
Farewell
That dream of yours
Have faith
Take me with you
A red cape
Pledge of justice
Wait! Strike!
"Thundaga Punch!"
With the crystals
Transformation!
Giant Kaiju
Knock'em down
Here we go
The burning sunset
A sign of victory
Someone's calling
"Blizzaga Kick!"
Love and courage
Fly away!
Peace in the universe
Protect at all cost
Knight in shining armor
A shining sword
Mark of the brave
Evil minions
"Firaga Attack!"
The power of friendship
"Fu....sion-HAAA!"
The wrath of the righteous
Stick to your principles
Hero of the galaxy
Sharp claws
Evil mind
Eat that! Deadly blow!
"Curaga Beam!"
In hot blood
Get the fire!
A giant enemy
Unforgivable
Invincible warrior
My father's boat
Growing up in the North of Japan
The Fisherman's Song
"Enyakora"
Decency and empathy
A sob story
Everlasting bond
Drinking to the last drop
Harbor city
Neon lights
Affection growing stronger
The ocean is gone
"Ah…Yosakoi"
At night, in a bar
Drinking sake
Heart and soul
Comforting
That's what men do
Seagulls off the coast
Hyururi hyururi lala
Writing a letter
"My Dear Mother…"
Crying over sake
Traveling alone
With a woman's heart
A grudge against
The enka way
After all, men are
The coldness stings
Pass on a message
This thought
Just leave it as it is
To hell with it!
Our lives
Do a favor
The night breeze is cold
My heart is
Dynami
Keep shouting
"Oh Yeah!"
Every time we hug
I love you
Tonight with you
Hold on
Kiss me baby
Midnight
Oh loneliness
I've said it many times
"Forever"
All night
I want you
Broken hearts
To abandon
One way love
Rock & roll is
A shout from the heart
In your eyes
"Come on tonight"
High beats
Dancing
Adult authority
Wreck
Sexy angels
This race is
Final lap
Howl at the moon
"Oh Jesus!"
Non-stop
Heat up
Feeling blue
Knock out
Sweet honey
